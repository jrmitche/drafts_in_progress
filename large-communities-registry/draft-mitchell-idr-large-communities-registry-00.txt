1.  Introduction

   The document [I-D.ietf-idr-large-community] specifies BGP Large
   Community attribute support for BGP [RFC4271] and reserves several
   values which should not be used as a global Global Administrator
   value, as well as instruction for the remaining values to be utilized
   by the owner of the ASN associated with the Global Administrator
   field.  That document did not specify the IANA registry to be created
   to make these reservations or the procedures for future assignments
   out of the reserved values.  This document provides such guidance to
   IANA.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create a new Border Gateway Parameters (BGP)
   protocols registry called "BGP Large Communities" and populate it
   with the following information.

   The following note has been added to the "BGP Large Communities"
   registry:

      This registry contains registration procedures based on the first
      four high-order octets of a BGP Large Community attribute.  Values
      listed in the table below must specify all 12 octets, high-order
      first upon allocation.

   +-------------------------+------------------------+
   | Range                   | Registration Procedure |
   +-------------------------+------------------------+
   | 0x00000000              | IETF Review            |
   | 0x00000001 - 0x0000FFFE | Private Use            |
   | 0x0000FFFF              | IETF Review            |
   | 0x00010000 - 0xFFFFFFFE | Private Use            |
   | 0xFFFFFFFF - 0xFFFFFFFF | IETF Review            |
   +-------------------------+------------------------+

   The reference for the Reserved values for Private Use should be
   listed as [I-D.ietf-idr-large-community], but it was not included in
   the text above due to line length limits in IETF text format.
